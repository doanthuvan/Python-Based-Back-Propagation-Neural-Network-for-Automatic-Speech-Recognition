# Python-Based-Back-Propagation-Neural-Network-for-Automatic-Speech-Recognition
A simple neural network was designed and trained using backpropogation algorithm for automatic speech recognition(for digits 0-9). The speech dataset included recordings of 4 speakers , with each speaker having 50 recordings per digit. MFCC ( Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients ) feature extraction technique was used to extract features from each recording. python_speech_features library by jameslyons was used to implement MFCC. The Python code was implemented on Jupyter Notebook.
